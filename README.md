## Introduction

In today's digital age, misinformation spreads quickly, often causing harm to individuals and misleading the public. Misattributions and false claims can damage reputations and distort public perception. This repository serves as a tool to combat such issues by providing verified evidence and clear fact-checking for statements attributed to individuals.

This project was inspired by the widespread phenomenon of people being misquoted or having words falsely attributed to them. The idea came from a meme that misquoted a public figure with harmful statements. This kind of misinformation is what we aim to correct.

## Mission Statement

The purpose of this repository is to uncover the truth about what a person has said and what they have not said. We emphasize that this project has no political affiliations. Our sole aim is to ensure that the truth prevails, based on verified evidence, without any bias. The repository will remain publicly available and open source for eternity, fostering transparency and collaboration.

## Using the Repository

This repository is organized to make it easy to find information about misattributions and false claims. Each individual has their own directory, which contains cases of misattribution along with the evidence and scripts used to verify the claims.

### Example Case

For each case, you will find (Located in folder `cases`):
- **Case name**: Name for a case is always the name of a person
- **Description**: A detailed account of the misattribution.
- **Evidence**: Supporting files such as videos, images, transcripts, and articles.
- **Scripts**: Code used to verify the quotes or gather evidence.
- **Results**: The outcome of the verification process.

### Schrödinger's Quotes

In some instances, we may not be able to find conclusive evidence to prove or disprove a statement. In such cases, we classify the quotes as "Schrödinger's Quotes," meaning they are both true and not true until proven otherwise.

## Scripts and Tools

We provide several scripts and tools to help with the verification process. These include:

- **verify_quote.py**: Script for verifying quotes.
- **scrape_data.py**: Script for web scraping to collect evidence.
- **transcribe_audio.py**: Script to transcribe audio/video files.
- **util.py**: Utility functions shared across scripts.

These scripts are located in the `scripts` directory and are essential for gathering and verifying evidence.
